# CuSMC

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

CuSMC is an R package for drawing random samples for a posterior probability distribution in Bayesian inference. CuSMC stands for CUDA Sequential Monte Carlo. CuSMC supports Metropolis-Hastings sampler and Multivariate Normal and Student-T distributions. 

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have a CUDA capable graphic processing unit and the CUDA SDK installed. Details on how to setup the CUDA SDK kit can be found [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html#installing-cuda-development-tools). 
```r
## Install the following packages from CRAN
install.package(devtools)
install.packages(Rcpp)
install.packages()
```

## Installation

You can install CuSMC from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("CuSMC")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(CuSMC)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
